            <h2>About me...</h2>

            <p>Welcome to my first webpage! I recently decided to push myself to learn a new skill and web development is what I landed on. 
              Although it is challenging, I know that the long term benefits will far offset the short term struggles and sacrifices. 
              With that being said, let me tell you a little more about myself.</p>

            <p>I grew up in the Central Florida area and after a 4 years (and a bonus football semester), I graduated with a B.S. in Economics.
              I after graduation I quickly began working in the Financial Department for Orange Lake Resorts, a part of the Holiday Inn conglomerate and have remained there for the past two years.

            <p>With the knowledge of front and back end systems and languages, my plan is to become a successful full stack freelance developer and take on projects as I travel domestically and abroad. </p>
  
            <p>Couple interesting things about myself...</p>
              <ul>•Love to fish as well as hunt. Elk is one of my favorite things to hunt as well as eat. </ul>
                  
                  <ul>•Have a greenthumb. I have been growing and eating my plants from my garden on and off for the past few years. </ul>
                 
                       <ul>•Distance runner. Run a few half marathons, im always chasing that runners high.</ul>
